This is a list of extra features that I could implement in the Lox interpreter:

1. String concatenation between numbers and strings (currently only supported between two strings)
2. Better error handling
3. Implementing do-while loops
4. Implement more arithmetic operators like bitwise (and, or, not), shifting, and modulo
5. Implement more conditional operators (like ternary ?)
